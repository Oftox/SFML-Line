# SFML-Line
an implementation of lines in SFML made as a test.

You can use WASD and the arrow keys to move and stretch the line.
Uses math to make RectangleShape into a line.

1. Calculates the distance between startpoint and endpoint
2. Calculates the midpoint of startpoint and endpoint
3. Sets the lines position to the midpoint
4. Sets the wideness of the line to the distance(5 pixels tall)
5. Rotates towards the endpoint.
